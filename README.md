This script automates the process of unsubscribing from YouTube channels using the YouTube Developer Console.

## Prerequisites

- An active YouTube account with subscribed channels.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [https://www.youtube.com/feed/channels](https://www.youtube.com/feed/channels).
2. Open the developer console:
   - For Google Chrome, press `Ctrl + Shift + J` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + J` (Mac).
   - For Mozilla Firefox, press `Ctrl + Shift + K` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + K` (Mac).
   - For other browsers, refer to the browser's documentation for opening the developer console.
3. Copy the code from the script file provided.
4. Paste the code into the console and press `Enter` to execute the script.
5. The script will start automating the unsubscription process by clicking on the notification preference buttons, selecting the unsubscribe option, and confirming the unsubscription.
6. After each action, the script will also scroll one-third of the screen width towards the bottom.
7. The script will continue until all subscribed channels are unsubscribed.
